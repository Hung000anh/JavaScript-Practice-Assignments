# 📐 Getter and Setter in JavaScript

This project demonstrates how `getter` and `setter` methods work in JavaScript classes for property encapsulation and validation.

## 🧠 Concepts

- **Getter**: Method to access (read) a property.
- **Setter**: Method to update (write) a property, often with validation.
- Both are used to protect and control internal class data.

## ✅ Example Output

```

Rectangle Details:
Width: 30
Height: 40
Area: 1200

```
