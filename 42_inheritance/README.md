# 🐾 JavaScript Inheritance Demo

This project demonstrates **Inheritance** in JavaScript using simple classes like `Animal`, `Rabbit`, `Fish`, and `Hawk`.

## 📚 Concept

> Inheritance allows a new class (child) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (parent), promoting **code reusability** and **clean design**.

### ✅ Classes

- `Animal` – Base class with shared properties and methods (`eat`, `sleep`, `alive`)
- `Rabbit`, `Fish`, `Hawk` – Inherit from `Animal` and have their own unique methods (`run`, `swim`, `fly`)
